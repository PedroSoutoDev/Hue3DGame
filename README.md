# Hue Game
Personal side project. First person puzzle game based on colors and player's field of view.

## Background
This is a small side project I worked on from late highschool to early college using the Unity Game Engine. I started and finished this project before realy learning about version control, and somewhere along the line lost the source code of the game. Eventually I found Windows version of the built game on an indie game website I had uploaded it to. The files on this GitHub are the Unity built version on the game, only compatible with Windows.

## Game Description
Vision and color is the name of the game.  
  
Use your sight to work your way through various levels. As you get further into the game, new puzzle designs are introduced, making each room progressively harder.  
  
When you look at colored triggers, the corresponding colored objects will appear. Look away from the trigger, and the objects will disappear! Your goal is to reach the red hallway at the end of the room.
